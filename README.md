Titanic Dataset Preprocessing
Overview
This project preprocesses the Titanic dataset (Titanic-Dataset.csv) to prepare it for machine learning tasks, such as predicting passenger survival. The preprocessing is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (titanic_preprocessing.ipynb), and the cleaned dataset is saved as titanic_cleaned.csv. This README explains the steps taken, the purpose of each, and how to use the deliverables.
Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers on the Titanic, with features like:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender (male, female).
Age: Age in years.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Ticket price (in pounds).
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

The goal was to clean and preprocess this dataset to make it suitable for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.
Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing is implemented in titanic_preprocessing.ipynb, with the following steps:

Data Import and Exploration:

Loaded Titanic-Dataset.csv using Pandas.
Inspected the dataset using df.info(), df.isnull().sum(), and df.describe() to identify missing values, data types, and summary statistics.
Findings:
Missing values: Age (177 missing, ~20%), Cabin (687 missing, ~77%), Embarked (2 missing).
Numerical columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare.
Categorical columns: Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, Embarked.




Handle Missing Values:

Dropped: Cabin (too many missing values, ~77%).
Imputed:
Age: Filled missing values with the median (~28) to avoid bias from outliers.
Embarked: Filled 2 missing values with the mode ('S', Southampton, the most common port).


Purpose: Ensure no missing values remain, as machine learning models require complete data.


Convert Categorical Features to Numerical:

Dropped: Name, Ticket, PassengerId (irrelevant for modeling).
Encoded:
Sex: Converted to numerical (male = 0, female = 1) using label encoding.
Embarked: One-hot encoded into three binary columns (Embarked_C, Embarked_Q, Embarked_S) with values 0 or 1.


Purpose: Machine learning models require numerical inputs, so categorical features were transformed.


Standardize Numerical Features:

Applied StandardScaler to Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch to standardize them (mean ≈ 0, standard deviation ≈ 1).
Purpose: Ensure numerical features are on the same scale, improving model performance for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude (e.g., SVM, neural networks).


Remove Outliers:

Visualized outliers in Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch using boxplots (before and after removal).
Used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers:
Calculated Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), and IQR (Q3 - Q1).
Removed rows where values were outside [Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR].


Result: Reduced dataset from 891 rows to ~577 rows (exact number depends on outliers).
Purpose: Outliers (e.g., very high Fare or large SibSp) can skew model predictions, so removing them improves robustness.




Deliverables

titanic_preprocessing.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all preprocessing code, with comments and outputs (e.g., data summaries, boxplots).
titanic_cleaned.csv: The preprocessed dataset, ready for machine learning.

How to Use

Prerequisites:

Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.
Install required libraries:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Place Titanic-Dataset.csv and titanic_preprocessing.ipynb in the same directory.


Run the Notebook:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook


Open titanic_preprocessing.ipynb and run all cells sequentially.
The notebook will:
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Generate boxplots to visualize outliers.
Save the cleaned dataset as titanic_cleaned.csv.




Verify Output:

Check titanic_cleaned.csv to ensure:
No missing values.
Numerical columns (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch) are standardized.
Sex and Embarked_* are numerical (0/1).


Review boxplots in the notebook to confirm outlier removal.


Use for Machine Learning:

The titanic_cleaned.csv file is ready for training models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict Survived.
Example: Use Survived as the target variable and other columns as features.



Notes

Data Loss: Outlier removal reduced the dataset size (~30–40% of rows dropped). This is expected but could be adjusted (e.g., cap outliers instead) for less data loss.
Scalability: The preprocessing steps (imputation, encoding, scaling, outlier removal) are standard and can be applied to similar datasets.
Further Analysis: To extend this work, you could:
Train a machine learning model on titanic_cleaned.csv.
Explore feature correlations (e.g., Fare vs. Pclass, SibSp vs. Parch).
Test alternative imputation methods (e.g., KNN for Age).
